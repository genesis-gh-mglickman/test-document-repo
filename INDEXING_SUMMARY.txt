Indexing Summary for test-document-repo

High-level summary
- Managed the todo lifecycle (IN_PROGRESS → AWAITING_INPUT → IN_PROGRESS → COMPLETED).
- Created a project-scoped document index: proj_Eve_CbpOeu.
- Initially blocked by 403 on web access; prepared a no-auth ZIP fallback.
- After git tools were fixed, cloned the repo directly into bot_git.
- Indexed the discovered PDF into the document index and verified it.

Step-by-step details
1) Initialization and setup
- Set todo status to IN_PROGRESS and logged start.
- Retrieved todo details to determine project_id for index naming (proj_Eve_CbpOeu).
- Checked existing document indices; created a new index: proj_Eve_CbpOeu.

2) Initial access attempt and fallback prep
- Tried web access to GitHub endpoints; received 403 Unauthorized (environment-level).
- Prepared a No-auth path:
  - Created staging folder at bot_git/external_sources/test-document-repo.
  - Registered it as a project asset for traceability.
- Set status to AWAITING_INPUT while waiting for archive/link or fixed tools.

3) Repo access after tools were fixed
- Resumed work (status back to IN_PROGRESS).
- Used git_action to clone directly:
  - clone_remote https://github.com/genesis-gh-mglickman/test-document-repo.git → cloned into bot_git/test-document-repo
  - list_files confirmed file: test-document-repo/bny-bookkeeping-activity.pdf

4) Ingestion into the document index
- Attempted directory-level ingestion:
  - document_index ADD_DOCUMENTS with BOT_GIT:test-document-repo → “File not readable” (directory-level add not supported here)
- Ingested the specific file:
  - document_index ADD_DOCUMENTS with BOT_GIT:test-document-repo/bny-bookkeeping-activity.pdf → Success
- Verified ingestion:
  - document_index LIST_DOCUMENTS (show_files_only=True) → 1 document present with extracted text.

5) Closeout
- Logged all actions and results.
- Set todo status to COMPLETED.

Artifacts and references
- Repo path (bot_git): test-document-repo/
- Indexed document: BOT_GIT:test-document-repo/bny-bookkeeping-activity.pdf
- Index name: proj_Eve_CbpOeu
- Staging asset (for no-auth fallback): external_sources/test-document-repo/README.md

Next steps (optional)
- Set up periodic sync-and-index to ingest new files.
- Parse the PDF into a structured reference (fields, positions, formats) and export a table.
- Re-run ingestion for any additional files added to the repo.
